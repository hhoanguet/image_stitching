# Image Stitching with Opencv
Image stitching or photo stitching 
is the process of combining multiple photographic images with overlapping fields of view to produce a segmented panorama or high-resolution image. 

## Examples
<img align="left" width = "350" height = "450" src="5.1.jpg">
<img align="right" width = "350" height = "450" src="5.2.jpg">

<p align="center">
  <img width = "600" src="result_image.png">
</p>
